## THis respository is for the version control of our R_code

If u have a piece of code that u just finish writing, feel free to add them here. Just click "Add file" and then upload the file are working on. Even you just figure out how to write a function in R-mark down, just upload them here (every step counts :) ).  Remember to comment and explain all the files you upload, so that it would be easy for team members to use them. 


Remember to name the the file upload here in this format: Name_Day uploaed_Assignment_Number  ( For example : Michael_21st_September_Assignment 1) 


THis is a version control software, so u can upload as many files as u want. You will also be able to access all the files of our group members. 

Cheers, 
Michael
